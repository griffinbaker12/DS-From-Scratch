Preface
- "Hack on things"

Ch1
- .sort() defaults to increasing order
- These are problems that you can actually work on and solve, which is really fricking cool. Like someone may pop by
your desk and say hey, we have this data, and want to use it to make recommendations for other things / people they
may also like. And I guess this book walks through ways that we can do this, from naive to complex approaches uses ML.
- Neovim is so fricking cool. Like the ability to completely customize your editors, your tools, and have them do 
exactly what is needed is much like ZoMM and his attachment to his bike.
- I loved stats in college and love programming obviously and this seems to be the union of the two so am very excited
to keep reading and learning.
