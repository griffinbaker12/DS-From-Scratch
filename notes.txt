Preface
- "Hack on things"

Ch1
- .sort() defaults to increasing order
- These are problems that you can actually work on and solve, which is really fricking cool. Like someone may pop by
your desk and say hey, we have this data, and want to use it to make recommendations for other things / people they
may also like. And I guess this book walks through ways that we can do this, from naive to complex approaches uses ML.
- Neovim is so fricking cool. Like the ability to completely customize your editors, your tools, and have them do 
exactly what is needed is much like ZoMM and his attachment to his bike.
- I loved stats in college and love programming obviously and this seems to be the union of the two so am very excited
to keep reading and learning.
- Iterable vs iterator vs sequence
    - Iterable -> object that has an __iter__ method which returns an iterator, or which defines a
    __getitem__ method that can take sequential indexes starting from zero (and raises an IndexError when
    the indexes are no longer valid); object that you can get an iterator from
    - Iterator -> Object with a __next__ method; whenever you use a for loop, or map, or a list comp (which
    is really cool, because when and if you build your own objects, you just need to implement the __next__
    method to play nicely with these language constructs...DATA MODEL...so cool) this method is called
    automatically to get each item from the iterator, thus going through the process of iteration 
        - So what is really cool here is that to implement the iterator protocol, you define an __iter__()
        method which returns an object with a __next__() method. If the class defines __next__(), you can
        just return self.
    - Sequence -> iterable which supports efficient element access using integer indices via the __getitem()__
    special method and defines a __len__() method that returns the sequence's length
        - Dicts also support these methods, but it is considered a mapping because the lookups use arbitrary
        immutable keys rather than integers
        - All sequences are iterables, but in addition to supporting one-at-a-time iteration, a sequence
        lets you jump directly to a given spot by index
    - Not every iterable is a sequence. There are lots of things that you can iterate over but can't get
    by an index (like a file or infinite streams).
    - The iterator protocol does not require the __len__() method be implemented, only to signal when
    there are no more items.

Iterator
- When you implement the __iter__() and __next__() methods in your class, it integrates seamlessly with 
Python's language constructs like for loops, map(), and list comps. These constructs implicitly call __next__()
under the hood to fetch items, enabling custom objects to be used in a familiar, intuitive way.
- Instead of focusing on how to get the next item, you can instead focus on what you want to do with it.

Ch2
- Probably don't import all of the contents of a module b/c you may inadvertantly overwrite variable names
you already defined
- Unhandled exceptions cause your program to crash
- slice[i:j] -> [i, j) (meaning that i is inclusive and j is not)
    - The third argument is known as the stride
- Clean Pythonic way to:
    - Create a list of sequential integers -> x = [i for i in range(10)]
        - Maybe a better way is: list(range(10))
    - Copy a list -> x[:]
    - If you want to go backwards through a list, the first number has to be larger than the second
- Tuples' are lists immutable cousins; pretty much anything that you can do to a list that doesn't 
involve modifying it,you can do to a tuple
- Default behavior for iterating dicts is to give you back the key
- Dictionary keys must be hashable; in particular, you can not use lists as keys. The reason is that lists
are mutable, and you need to use something immutable as a key.
    - An object is hashable if it has a hash value that stays consistent durings its lifetime. 
- Default dicts are useful when we want to use dicts to "collect" results by some key and don't want to have
to check everytime to see if the key exists yet
    - When you look up a key it doesn't contain, it first adds a value for it using a zero-arg fn you provide
    when you created it
- Sets are useful for fast lookups and to get all of the unique elements in a collection
- You should use "is None" vs "== None" because classes are free to implement comparisons anyway they choose
    - 'is' checks for object identity, and there is only 1 None object
    - '==' checks for equivalence, which can change from object to object
- any() and all() are cool fucntions which help you check for truthiness of the items within an iterable
- sorted() returns a new list, .sort() modifies the list in place; both default from naively sorting from
smallest to largest
- If you only want the elements one at a time, there's no good reason to keep a bunch of numbers around...
enter -> GENERATORS
   - Can be iterated over just like lists, but generate their values lazily on demand 
   - Range itself is lazy, but to create an iterator, you can do something like:
        def gen_range(n):
            i = 0
            while i < n:
                yield i
                i+=1
    - Generators maintain their internal state
    - Infinite sequence:
        def nat_nums():
            i = 1
            while True:
                yield i
                i+=1
    - Flip side of laziness is that you can only iterate through the generator once 
    - And what this means (being lazy), is that nothing happens until you iterate over it using 'for in' or
    'next'
- Zip -> zips two or more iterables together, returning a single iterable of corresponding function
    - Know if something is lazy or not because when you call the function, it will return an object you 
    then need to iterate over
- Type hints are just Python objects as well, so they can be assinged to variables to make them
easier to refer to
